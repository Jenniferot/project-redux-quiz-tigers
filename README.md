# Redux quiz group project

This was a group project we did while attending Technigo 24 week frontend program. Our team's task was to build a quiz game using Redux. It's a multiple choice quiz, and we decided to make a Harry Potter quiz.

## The problem

The project had a predefined Redux store and a reducer with a few actions we could use to control our quiz. This was our  first project with Redux so it was hard to wrap our head around the concept and how to get it to work. The first day we did mob programming the entire team together, but the second day we split up in smaller groups focusing on different problems.
